Rust MythBuster
===============
Analyses how many Rust functions are unsafe in a given repository.

## Purporse
Have you ever witnessed a Rust developer being annoying? If not, this means this document was printed out and sent to you by mail, since you do not use the internet.
This program (if one can even call it that) is made for people less fortunate than you.
People who have had the misfortune of experiencing the arrogance of certain products of convergent evolution.
It is for those who know that in order to do something real, the keyword `unsafe` would be used.
But who were smart enough not to go through repositories and count the unsafe functions to win an online argument.
They knew a tool would exist for it. This is that tool
